##### Step One

When you call the file bamazonCustomer.js in Node.JS, a table containing the data from MySQL should appear.  The table is generated by a npm (Node Package Manager.....or NO PEOPLE MATTER or Nightwing Plays Mahjong or Nobody Protects Me, etc.) called cli-table.  Under the table is the first question asking you to enter the product number of the item that you would like to purchase.

##### Step 2

If you answer a correct item id, it will move onto the next question asking you of what quantity of that item you would like to purchase.

##### Step 3

Finally, after you have entered in a quantity that is available for purchase, then will inform you that it has put the items into your cart and it will give you a grand total of all the items you would like to purchase.
